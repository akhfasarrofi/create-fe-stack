# Rules and Source Contribution Guidelines üìù

- **Documentation**: All project documentation is maintained in the [project's wiki](https://internal.komerce.id).
- **Language**: All code must be written in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**.
- **Code Quality**: Ensure that the code is clean, well-organized, and easy to read.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow these naming conventions:
   - Use `camelCase` for files.
   - Use `lowercase` for folder names.
- **Data Types**: Never use the `any` data type unless it's necessary, such as when you don't know the variable's data type or when the data type is dynamic.
- **Creating New Pages**:
   1. If you are creating a feature for `komship`, create a folder in `src/features/home/komship`. If it's for `kompack`, create a folder in `src/features/home/kompack`.
   2. Open the `routes.tsx` file and add a new route for your page. Here's an example:
      ```tsx
      {
        // komship
        { 
          path: "expedition", 
          element: <Komship />; 
        },
        
        // kompack
        { 
          path: "warehouse", 
          element: <Kompack />; 
        },
      }
      ```
      Add routing to the code above by adjusting it according to the features you created. If the feature has child routes, add them as needed (e.g., `path: 'expedition/:id'`).
   3. Don't forget to add data types to the `types` folder. The `general.tsx` file should contain data types that can be used throughout the project.

These guidelines are meant to maintain code quality, consistency, and documentation for the project.

## Stack Front-End Quick Setup Script
This is a Bash script that simplifies the process of creating a front-end project with various framework, state management, and component library options. The script allows users to quickly and easily set up a front-end project with their preferred stack. You can download the script from GitHub using wget with the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhfasarrofi/create-fe-stack/main/setup.sh.

## How to Use the Script
1. Download the script using wget:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhfasarrofi/create-fe-stack/main/setup.sh
```
2. Provide execute permission to the script:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
3. Run the script:
```bash
./setup.sh
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to create your front-end project according to your preferences.

## Quick Overview
 - Framework Selection: The script allows you to choose a front-end framework such as Next.js, Vite, or Vue.js.
 - State Management (Only for Next.js and Vue.js): If you choose Next.js or Vue.js, you can select state management options like Zustand, Redux, Jotai (for Next.js), or Vuex, Pinia, Mobx (for Vue.js).
 - Component Library (Only for Next.js and Vue.js): If you choose Next.js or Vue.js, you can select component libraries like Material-UI, Ant-Design, Chakra-UI, Next-UI (for Next.js), or Vuetify, Bootstrap Vue, Element Plus, Ant Design, Chakra UI (for Vue.js).
 - Project Structure: After selecting your preferences, the script will create a project directory with the name you specify and install all the required dependencies.
